==================

This is an interesting project designed to read data from Twitter's API; designed to help my wife collect data for her Master's thesis.  

Involves scraping data from Twitter stream, to analyze for frequencies of certain keywords over time.  This is just the data collection part of the project, the analytics part is separate.
